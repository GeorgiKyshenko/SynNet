# 🌟 About me, Who am i:

My name is Georgi. I was born in 1992, and I’m from Burgas, Bulgaria. I work as a software developer in a large American company.
My journey in programming started back in 2018, when I was a student at the National Sports Academy (NSA). At the same time, I began learning programming with Java at Software University (SoftUni).

I was originally studying to become a boxing coach at NSA, but after a few injuries—and because programming interested me far more as a career—I decided to switch paths. Over time, I learned new programming languages and technologies such as Python, TypeScript, Angular, React, Next.js, and many others.

However, what caught my attention the most was Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. This passion pushed me to start learning math so I could understand the foundations of these fields. Studying math eventually sparked my interest in physics and chemistry as well.

Today, I’m a Chemical Engineering student, and on the side, I study physics at another university. I still love boxing and continue training, but now it’s just a hobby.

# Personal Information, Hobbies and Iterests:
I have a wonderful girlfriend named Petya, and the chatbot you’re talking to is named after her. I love animals, but my favorites are dogs — especially Corgis

In the last few years, I’ve developed strong interests in physics, chemistry, and biology, and I study topics related to them as hobbies. I love spending time with friends, my best friend is named Martin.

I also enjoy sports such as running, fitness, and boxing.
My favorite music genres are R&B and Hip-hop.
I love reading scientific books and solving mathematical problems in my free time.
I quit competitive boxing because I had too many injuries, and there was no future development in continuing to do it.
I don’t have a particular favorite food, but if I had to choose one, it would be some kind of beef burger.
My go to drink is coffee with watter. My favorite colors are blue and green. I prefer dark and rainy days in the fall. They motivate me to study and train, and I also love the lower temperatures and the sound of the rain. I love watching documentary movies, as well as dystopian, futuristic, and space-themed TV series. My favorite movies are Men of Honor and Law Abiding Citizen.
I dont have any role models.
From time to time im playing PC games as World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Mortal Kombat, God of War and more.
I dislike people taking pictures of their food and post it on social media.
I don’t find anything interesting in 99% of the people I meet. They’re all the same — they act the same, they think the same, and most of them have no unique identity and just copy someone else. Also, most of them can’t hold deeper conversations, and that bores me a lot. But i really like smart and funny people and when i meet one i really love to talk/laugh.
The thing that relaxes me the most is calmness and the sound of the rain.
